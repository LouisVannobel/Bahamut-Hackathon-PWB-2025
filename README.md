## Project Overview
LooserBracket is a platform that combines gambling and liquid staking on the Bahamut blockchain. By integrating the Proof-of-Stake & Activity (POSA) algorithm and verifiable randomness via the Erinaceus oracle, it delivers an experience that generates economic returns for users while they play.

## Features
- **Verifiable Random Results**: Roulette with random results via Erinaceus VRF.
- **Dual Token System**: Bet with FTN or LBR for different rewards.
- **Automatic Minting**: LBR minting when losing with FTN.
- **POSA Rewards**: Staking rewards powered by POSA algorithm.
- **Smart Gaming**: Gamified platform with optimized financial logic.
- **Secure Platform**: Built with robust security measures.
- **3D Environment**: Metaverse environment for gameplay and staking.
- **Yield Generation**: Earn passive income through staking.

## How It Works
1. **Connect & Choose**: Connect your wallet and choose whether to bet with FTN or LBR.
2. **Place Your Bet**: Spin the roulette (Red or Black).
3. **Receive Rewards**: If you win, you receive FTN. If you lose, you get LBR (when betting FTN).
4. **Stake & Earn**: LBR is backed by staked FTN.
5. **Grow Together**: The more people play, the more on-chain activity → higher rewards for everyone (Proof of Stake and Activity).

## Bahamut Blockchain
Bahamut is an EVM-based, layer 1, public blockchain solution that aims to transform how distributed networks approach block rewards among network participants by adding a crucial parameter to the algorithm - activity.

### Key Features
- **EVM Compatibility**: Deploy and run your dApps on Bahamut with your favorite tooling for Ethereum.
- **Fast Finality**: The average block time of Bahamut is 10 seconds.
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Gas fees are currently minimal and paid in $FTN.

## Development
To interact with Bahamut, you'll need an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Metamask or Yo Wallet.

### Deploy Smart Contracts on Bahamut
- **Using Hardhat or Remix**: Set up, compile, test, and deploy your contracts.
